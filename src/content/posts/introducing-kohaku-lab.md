# Welcome to Kohaku Lab

Hey everyone! Welcome to Kohaku Lab - a virtual laboratory made by AI/ML enthusiasts who build tools we actually want to use.

## What Is Kohaku Lab?

We're not your typical research lab. There's no physical building, no corporate backing, and no formal hierarchy. Just a group of people who got frustrated with existing tools and decided to build better ones.

### How It Started

Simple: we all had itches to scratch.

We all use text-to-image models. Commercial APIs are expensive, existing open models had limitations. So we trained **HDM** at home on consumer hardware.

We all used HuggingFace for model hosting. Then their policies shifted in ways we didn't like. So we built **KohakuHub**.

We all used Weights & Biases for experiment tracking. Limitations and pricing got annoying. So we created **KohakuBoard**.

We needed better fine-tuning techniques. So we developed **LyCORIS**.

**Pattern:** Need a tool? Build it yourself. Share it openly. Use it daily.

That's Kohaku Lab.

## The Philosophy

We build things we want to use. That's the whole philosophy.

If we're not using it ourselves, why would we build it? If it doesn't solve a real problem we have, what's the point?

This means:

1. **We're our own users** - We know if something sucks because we use it daily
2. **Real problems only** - No building for the sake of building
3. **Practical over theoretical** - If it doesn't work in practice, it doesn't work
4. **Share openly** - If it helps us, it might help others too

No grand mission statements, no five-year plans. Just people solving their own problems and sharing the solutions.

## Open Access

Everything we create is openly accessible. Some projects use permissive open-source licenses, others may use non-commercial licenses to protect our work while still sharing it freely for research and learning.

The point is: if you want to learn from our code, use our tools, or build on our research, you can. No paywalls, no proprietary secrets.

## Join Us

Interested in getting involved? Here's the thing: we don't have an application process or formal onboarding. Just:

1. Check out our projects on GitHub
2. Find something that interests you
3. Start contributing, asking questions, or sharing ideas

That's it. If you're passionate about AI/ML and want to build cool stuff with like-minded people, you're already qualified.

## What's Next

We'll be sharing more about our individual projects, technical deep-dives, research insights, and lessons learned. Stay tuned for posts about:

- The road of HDM
- A real "hub", a full-stack ML platforms
- And whatever else we find interesting!

Thanks for stopping by. Hope to see you around!
