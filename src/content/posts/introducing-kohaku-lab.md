# Welcome to Kohaku Lab

Hey everyone! Welcome to Kohaku Lab - a virtual laboratory made by AI/ML enthusiasts from around the internet.

## What Is Kohaku Lab?

We're not your typical research lab. There's no physical building, no corporate backing, and no formal hierarchy. Just a group of people who love AI/ML and enjoy building cool stuff together.

### How It Started

It started simply: a few enthusiasts chatting online about machine learning, sharing ideas, and eventually deciding to collaborate on projects. What began as casual conversations turned into real projects with real impact.

## Our Projects

We've built some pretty cool things:

- **LyCORIS**: Advanced fine-tuning techniques that go beyond conventional LoRA methods
- **HDM**: A text-to-image model trained at home on consumer hardware
- **KohakuHub**: An open platform for hosting and sharing ML models
- **KohakuBoard**: Experiment tracking and visualization for ML research

## The Philosophy

**Powered by passion.** That's really what it comes down to. We build things because:

1. They're interesting to us
2. We learn a ton in the process
3. It's fun to create tools that others can use
4. We believe good tools should be accessible to everyone

No grand mission statements, no five-year plans. Just people doing what they love.

## Open Access

Everything we create is openly accessible. Some projects use permissive open-source licenses, others may use non-commercial licenses to protect our work while still sharing it freely for research and learning.

The point is: if you want to learn from our code, use our tools, or build on our research, you can. No paywalls, no proprietary secrets.

## Join Us

Interested in getting involved? Here's the thing: we don't have an application process or formal onboarding. Just:

1. Check out our projects on GitHub
2. Find something that interests you
3. Start contributing, asking questions, or sharing ideas

That's it. If you're passionate about AI/ML and want to build cool stuff with like-minded people, you're already qualified.

## What's Next

We'll be sharing more about our individual projects, technical deep-dives, research insights, and lessons learned. Stay tuned for posts about:

- The road of HDM
- A real "hub", a full-stack ML platforms
- And whatever else we find interesting!

Thanks for stopping by. Hope to see you around!
